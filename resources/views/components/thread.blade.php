                Im doing 9-10k Monthly. but as desperate as i am... Im looking to do more :)
                Is this another Amazon or Ebay resell BS? I have bought a few ebooks past months and I can say everyone seems to copy everyones method....
                Some guy I bought ebook from claimed Skype support when he never logged in... etc etc.. I only have bad experiences when it comes to ebooks etc.
                Can you please PM me some more info..? Im tired of wasting money on ebooks anymore and I think everyone would be the same as me if they were in my shoes..
                I love to invest, but invest in stuff that actually works.
